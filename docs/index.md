## What is bEpic ImageViewer?

bEpic ImageViewer is a custom node extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that replaces the built-in preview with a powerful, dockable viewer panel. Instead of hunting through tiny preview nodes scattered across your canvas, every output is routed here — organised into named tabs, kept in a scrollable history, and ready for detailed inspection.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multi-Tab Organisation** | Route different outputs to named tabs. Reorder by drag, close with ×. |
| **History Snapshots** | Up to 20 generations per tab shown as thumbnails. Navigate with ↑ ↓. |
| **Image Comparison** | Vertical or horizontal split with a draggable divider. Compare tabs or history items. |
| **Playback & Timeline** | Play image sequences, set FPS, loop modes, scrub frames, select sub-ranges. |
| **Exposure & Channels** | ±4 EV exposure slider. Isolate R/G/B channels for data inspection. |
| **Parameter Panel** | Live widget values for the selected ComfyUI node — editable in the viewer. |
| **File Browser** | Browse ComfyUI's folders — and any you allow — in a panel, preview images and video, drag files into the viewer or onto the graph. |
| **Send from Any Node** | Right-click a VHS / native / AYON loader → *Send to Image Viewer*, or any image-producing node to run just its branch. |
| **Frame to Graph** | Shift-drag the timeline onto the graph for a Load Image node holding the frame on screen — a video frame is extracted to a PNG beside the clip, or to `output/extracted_frames` for clips outside ComfyUI's folders. |
| **Dockable Panels** | Drag any panel by its title bar to either side of the picture, or stack it above another. Splitters between them, arrangement remembered. |
| **3D Models** | View GLB, glTF, FBX, OBJ, STL and PLY like ComfyUI's Save 3D Model does, and save meshes and 3D files from the send node. |
| **3D Previz** | Build a scene from models and primitive shapes, move them with a gizmo, set cameras, keyframe everything on a value-graph curve editor, and render the shot back into the workflow as an mp4. |
| **USD Stages** | Open `.usd` / `.usdz` assets, and export or import whole previz shots as USD — payloaded assets, baked animation, cameras. |
| **Undock / Multi-Monitor** | Pop the viewer into its own browser window for a second screen. |

## How It Works

The extension registers a floating panel (`<bepic-viewer-panel>`) using the Web Components API with Shadow DOM — so its styles never conflict with ComfyUI's own UI. On the backend, a **bEpic Send To Image Viewer** node converts image tensors to PNG, saves them to ComfyUI's temp directory, and pushes a `bepic.viewer.update` WebSocket message to the frontend. The viewer picks it up and populates the relevant tab automatically.

All viewer state — open tabs, history stacks, panel positions, layouts — is persisted to `localStorage` so your workspace survives page reloads.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension via ComfyUI Manager or git clone into `custom_nodes/`. See [Installation & Setup](sub/getting-started.md).
2. Click **Toggle bEpic Image Viewer** in the ComfyUI action bar to open the panel.
3. Add a **bEpic Send To Image Viewer** node to your workflow and connect any image output to its `input` pin.
4. Set an optional `tab_name` on the node, then run your workflow. The image appears in the viewer instantly.
5. Hover the panel and press `?` for the built-in hotkey overlay at any time.
