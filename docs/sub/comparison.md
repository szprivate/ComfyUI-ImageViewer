## Starting a Comparison

### Compare Two Tabs

1. Make sure both tabs you want to compare are open and contain images.
2. <kbd>Shift</kbd>+click the **first** tab to mark it as the base image (a cyan highlight appears on the tab).
3. <kbd>Shift</kbd>+click the **second** tab — the viewer enters split-view immediately.

### Compare Two History Snapshots

1. Navigate to the tab whose history you want to compare.
2. <kbd>Shift</kbd>+click one thumbnail in the history strip to select it as base.
3. <kbd>Shift</kbd>+click another thumbnail — split-view opens.

> [!TIP]
> Press <kbd>C</kbd> while hovering the viewer to toggle comparison mode on/off without losing your comparison pair selection.

## The Compare Divider

In split-view, a bright white divider line separates the two images. Drag it left/right (vertical split) or up/down (horizontal split) to reveal more of either image. The divider position is remembered per session.

## Orientation Modes

The **Rotate** button in the toolbar cycles through three modes:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Vertical Split** (default) | Left/right division — classic A/B wipe. Drag divider horizontally. |
| **Horizontal Split** | Top/bottom division. Drag divider vertically. |
| **Contact Sheet** | Both images stacked vertically in full — no divider, scroll to compare. |

### Sources of Different Resolution

You can compare media that don't share a resolution or aspect ratio — a 1080p render against a 720p one, an image sequence against a video, or a portrait clip against a landscape one. **The second source is scaled to cover the first one's frame exactly**: the two always occupy the identical rectangle on screen, so the divider has picture on both sides of it everywhere it goes.

- **Same aspect ratio** — the two land exactly on top of each other, whatever resolutions they were written at. A 1024×1024 preview and its 2048×2048 upscale wipe against each other pixel for pixel.
- **Different aspect ratio** — the second source is stretched to the first one's rectangle, so its aspect ratio is deliberately not preserved. A 480×832 clip compared to a 1920×1080 plate is pulled out to the full width of the plate. That is the trade: a distorted second image, in exchange for a wipe that covers the whole frame instead of a narrow band down the middle of it.

Both wipe directions scale the same way, so cycling between **Vertical Split** and **Horizontal Split** doesn't resize anything. **Contact Sheet** doesn't scale this way at all — it scales both to a shared height, undistorted, and lays them out side by side.

Resizing the viewer — dragging the panel, or resizing and maximising the undocked window — keeps the two locked to the same rectangle at every size.

The match is re-derived whenever either side's size becomes known or changes — a clip whose dimensions arrive late, a second source swapped in with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+click, a resized panel. It applies the same way to two tabs and to two pinned history snapshots; snapshots of the same tab usually share a resolution, so there is nothing to correct there.

## Exiting Comparison Mode

Press <kbd>C</kbd> while hovering the viewer, or click a tab without holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>. The viewer returns to single-image display on the last active tab.

## Comparison with Playback

Comparison mode works simultaneously with the playback timeline — both the base and compare image update as you scrub or play frames. This is useful for comparing animated sequences frame-by-frame at the same timestamp.

> [!NOTE]
> When comparing two tabs with different frame counts, the shorter sequence will loop or hold on its last frame depending on the loop mode setting.
